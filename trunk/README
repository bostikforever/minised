				small-sed
		(by Eric S. Raymond, <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>

This is a smaller, cheaper, faster SED utility. Minix uses it. GNU used
to use it, until they built their own sed around an extended (some would
say over-extended) regexp package and it is used for embedded tasks (e.g.
by the T2 SDE <http://www.t2-project.org>).

The original sed 1.0 was written in three pieces; sed.h, sedcomp.c, sedexec.c.
Some Minix hacker ran them together into a single-file version, mnsed.c which
is not supported and shipped these days; if changes are needed for Minix please
send a patch to the normal source.

The 1.2 version (9 Oct 1996) add mnsed's support for detecting
truncated hold spaces. The mnsed version is missing one feature in
of the 1.2 version; support of +. Also, the multiple-file I/O is
organized slightly differently.

The 1.3 version added a bug fix by Tom Oehser, and the `L' command.  Also
this program is now distributed under GPL.

The 1.5 version incooperated a lot of bug fixes by Rene Rebe as well as
a real test suite. Also the function declaration and definition have been
converted from the K&R C to ANSI C.

The 1.6 version includes support for the n'th match for the substitude command
as well as support for predefined character classes.

Makefile	-- how to build sed
sed.h		-- declarations and structures
sedcomp.c	-- sed pattern compilation
sedexec.c	-- sed program execution
sed.1		-- source for the man page
tests/		-- a small set of sed tests

For this release I have put the man page in man format.

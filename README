				small-sed
		(by Eric S. Raymond, <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>)

This is a smaller, cheaper, faster SED utility.  Minix uses it.  GNU used
to use it, until they built their own sed around an extended (some would
say over-extended) regexp package.

My original sed 1.0 was written in three pieces; sed.h, sedcomp.c, sedexec.c.
Some Minix hacker ran them together into a single-file version, mnsed.c.

The mnsed version is missing one feature in my 1.1 version; support of +. 
Also, the multiple-file I/O is organized slightly differently.
I give both versions here.

For this archive release I have put the man page in man format.

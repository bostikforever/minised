				small-sed

This is a smaller, cheaper, faster SED utility.  Minix uses it.  GNU used
to use it, until they built their own sed around an extended (some would
say over-extended) regexp package and it is used for embedded tasks (e.g.
by the T2 SDE (http://www.t2-project.org).

My original sed 1.0 was written in three pieces; sed.h, sedcomp.c, sedexec.c.
Some Minix hacker ran them together into a single-file version, mnsed.c.

My 1.2 version (9 Oct 1996) add mnsed's support for detecting
truncated hold spaces.  The mnsed version is missing one feature in
my 1.2 version; support of +.  Also, the multiple-file I/O is
organized slightly differently.  I give both versions here.

The 1.3 version added a bug fix by Tom Oehser, and his `L' command.  Also
this program is now distributed under GPL.

Makefile	-- how to build sed
sed.h		-- declarations and structures
sedcomp.c	-- sed pattern compilation
sedexec.c	-- sed program execution
ctrans		-- partial Pascal-to-C translation
sed.1		-- source for the man page
sedtest		-- a small sed test load

For this release I have put the man page in man format.
